**Development Mode**

To run the app in development mode, go to the frontend project directory and execute:

**npm start**

Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.

You may also see any lint errors in the console.

**Production Build**

To create a production build of the application, go to the frontend project directory and execute:

**npm run build**

To build the app for production to the build folder.

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

For our project we have deployed the build file to Vercel. Vercel is a cloud platform for static sites and serverless functions that enables developers to deploy websites and applications quickly and efficiently.
