John Smith: Good morning, everyone. Let's begin today's meeting with a project status update. Sarah, can you provide an overview of where we stand?

Sarah Johnson: Sure, John. We're on track with our development tasks. As of now, we've completed 80% of the coding phase. Testing is underway, and we've encountered a few minor issues that we're addressing.

Michael Brown: In terms of quality assurance, we've conducted preliminary testing on Modules A and B. We'll need another week to complete the initial testing phase and address any critical issues.

John Smith: Thank you, Sarah and Michael. Lisa, any feedback from the client regarding the recent progress?

Lisa Davis: The client is satisfied with the updates so far. They did raise a concern about the timeline for Module C, which is critical for their marketing campaign. They would like it to be prioritized.

John Smith: Noted, Lisa. We'll discuss this further in the task assignments section. Mark, any updates on the budget?

Mark Roberts: Budget-wise, we are within the planned expenditure for this phase. However, we need to keep a close eye on additional resources required for prioritizing Module C.

John Smith: Understood. Let's move on to task assignments. Sarah, can you reassign resources to prioritize Module C?

Sarah Johnson: Yes, I'll reallocate some team members to Module C, and we'll aim to accelerate its development.

John Smith: Great. Emily, please document this change in the project plan. Now, let's address any issues. Michael, could you provide an update on the reported bugs?

Michael Brown: We've identified five minor bugs that need attention. Three are related to UI issues, one is a performance concern, and the last one is a compatibility issue with Internet Explorer.

John Smith: Please assign these issues to the respective team members for resolution. Now, about milestones...

John Smith: Before we adjourn, let's recap the action items:
Sarah to reallocate resources for Module C.
Michael to assign bugs for resolution.
Emily to update the project plan.
Lisa to communicate Module C prioritization to the client.
Mark to monitor budget closely.

John Smith: Thank you, everyone. This concludes today's meeting. Our next meeting is scheduled for September 17th at the same time. Have a productive week!
