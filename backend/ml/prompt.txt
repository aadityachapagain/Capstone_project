By considering the ontology below:

1. **Participants**
   - Attributes: Name, Role (e.g., Developer, Project Manager, Systems Analyst), Contact Information
   - Relationships: attends, participates in, leads

2. **Meeting**
   - Attributes: Meeting ID, Title, Date, Time, Duration, Location (physical or virtual), Agenda, Minutes
   - Relationships: has participants, discusses topics, results in decisions, has follow-up actions

3. **Agenda Items**
   - Attributes: Item ID, Description, Time Allotted, Presenter
   - Relationships: part of meeting, related to project/component, requires discussion, may have associated documents

4. **Decisions**
   - Attributes: Decision ID, Description, Outcome, Decision Date
   - Relationships: made during meeting, affects projects/components, requires follow-up actions

5. **Follow-up Actions**
   - Attributes: Action ID, Description, Responsible Party, Deadline, Status (e.g., pending, in progress, completed)
   - Relationships: assigned during meeting, related to decision, affects project/component

6. **Projects/Components**
   - Attributes: Project ID, Name, Description, Start Date, End Date, Status
   - Relationships: discussed in meetings, affected by decisions, involves participants

7. **Documents**
   - Attributes: Document ID, Title, Type (e.g., report, presentation), Author, Creation Date, Modification Date, Link/Location
   - Relationships: associated with agenda items, referenced in decisions, may result from follow-up actions

Create a json file that is for a mind map. The nodes and edges are weighted and labeled.

The structure should be like:
(EXAMPLE)
MEETING
1.
1.1.
1.2.
1.2.1.
1.2.2.
2.
2.1.
...
ETC.

These points should align with the ontology. The first element of the ontology maps to the first subheading and it's children should follow the same pattern as other elements.

Have the following fields in the json file:
nodes: id, label, group, weight, reference
links: source, target, label, weight

Link labels should explain how and why those two nodes are linked.

Have proper group names for each group.

The "reference" field is an array of arrays with numbers to map the nodes and links to the original conversation.
For example if there are two arrays in the array, that means the node or the link is referenced in two different places in the conversation. The first number of the first array is index where the first highlight starts and the second number of the first array is the index where the first highlight ends. The first number of the second array is index where the second highlight starts and the second number of the second array is the index where the second highlight ends.

Make sure the ontology it considered deeply. If the ontology points are not included in the transcription, you can omit those nodes. However, collect and include all the asked points in the ontology where possible in the json file. Answer all the points in the ontology.

Follow a hierarchical structure just like a mind map. Only have parent child relationship.
